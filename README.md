# BrickManager2
java based app to manage BrickLink uploads/downloads via batch

BrickManager (aka BM2) is a descendant of an app I wrote beginning somewhere around 2002/2003. The original was called App2.

BM2 is a Java based app (most recently compiled against 1.8), and utilizing the java frameworks to access Mac based windows/menus. It's core concept is to maintain an offline working inventory, combined with an offline simple representation of the catalog. both of those can be updated from BL batch downloads. BM2 generates XML upload files for adding/updating the online BL store inventory.

Put simply, it works, but there is much work remaining. As I become more familiar with GitHub, I will be upading all the various bits to allow compilation. Early days I was using XCode, but eventually migrated to Eclipse.
